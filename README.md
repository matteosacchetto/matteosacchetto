### Hi there, I'm Matteo Sacchetto 👋

I'm a PhD student at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications (**DET**) in the 🏫 **Politecnico di Torino**, *Turin - Italy*, where I recently finished my Master's degree in Computer Sicence with Data Science orientation
  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [JackTrip-WebRTC](https://github.com/jacktrip-webrtc/jacktrip-webrtc), a low latency web app for network music performance
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VueJS 
- 💬 Ask me about music, piano, programming, Raspberry Pi, cakes, ... Let's say anything :sweat_smile:
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: The HTTP **418 I'm a teapot** client error response code indicates that the server refuses to brew coffee because it is, permanently, a teapot. A combined coffee/tea pot that is temporarily out of coffee should instead return 503. This error is a reference to [Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324) defined in April Fools' jokes in 1998 and 2014. - Source: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418)
